# MultiTextCopyPaste - Project Files
A simple PowerPoint COM Add-In for Copy and Pasting Multiple Textboxes simultaneously.
Highlights my process of making simple functionality but also exploring the various aspects when it comes to deploying the add-in.

# Why did I make it?
A fun little experiment to expedite my own workflow when manipulating and cleaning up slides in PowerPoint.

# Credits
All credit to the design of the copy and paste icons goes to Flaticon.
